# -5-staged-pipelined-MIPS-Processor
A 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor is a type of RISC processor that divides instruction execution into five stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). This technique allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously by different stages, improving overall performance .
